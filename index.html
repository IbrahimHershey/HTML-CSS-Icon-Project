    <p> It was 7:59pm EST. August 31st. College football was finally back after nearly six months. The Florida Gators were taking on the Utah Utes. Only one more minute until kickoff. Then all of a sudden. <p/>

    <p> POOF. Everything went black. <p/>

    <p> Nobody knew what was going on. Fans were outraged thinking it was their TVs but they quickly needed to look for an alternative. Then all of a sudden a message popped up: <p/>

    <p> After a couple minutes, people started to realize what was going on. Disney and Spectrum were struggling over the terms of their distribution agreement. Both sides could not reach a deal and Disney blacked out their programming on Spectrum TVs. <p/>

    <p> As a result, nearly <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/dispute-disney-spectrum/story?id=102926362">15 million</a> Spectrum subscribers lost access to ESPN, ABC, and other Disney channels; They had to wait close to three hours on hold over the weekend as they tried to cancel their Spectrum subscriptions. <p/>

  <p> Spectrum subscribers watched more than <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-charter-spectrum-dispute/">3.3 billion</a> hours of content on Disney networks and stations over the past year. This number will potentially be affected by
the blackout of Disney programs on Spectrum TV because Disney and Spectrumâ€™s sole purpose is to make as much money as possible. Even though these companies are worth millions and billions of dollars, they fail to realize that the customer always comes first. <p/>

<p> Many Spectrum members also switched from Spectrum to a streaming service because it is cheaper, no box, less ads, and a variety of content. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/01/business/charter-disney-cable-fight.html">The traditional</a> cable model TV is outdated, expensive, broken, and unnecessary. As a result, streaming services have caused lots of pressure and problems for cable companies as well as losing money and customers. <p/>
